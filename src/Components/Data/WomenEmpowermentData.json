    "description": "We are committed to advancing women’s empowerment and gender inclusion across Gujranwala’s industrial and entrepreneurial landscape. By fostering an enabling environment for women entrepreneurs, professionals, and students, the Alliance ensures that women play an active role in shaping the region’s economic future. Through strategic collaborations with women’s chambers of commerce, educational institutions, and development organisations, GBA has created meaningful opportunities for female participation in trade, entrepreneurship, and leadership. Women are actively engaged in GBA’s major initiatives - including international exhibitions, growth windows, and industry–academia programs - gaining exposure to global markets and business networks. Building on this commitment, GBA and its partners are spearheading the establishment of Gujranwala’s first Women Chamber of Commerce & Industry, a landmark initiative that will serve as the cornerstone of women-led business growth, innovation, and international connectivity in the region.",
